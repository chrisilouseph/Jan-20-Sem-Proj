# Jan '20 Semester Project

This repository contains all my saved work in Haskell, Coq and Lean from December '19 to June '20 during my winter and semester projects with Dr Vivek Mallick at IISER Pune.

## Coq

This small folder is mostly me experimenting with [Mike Nahas's Coq Tutorial](https://mdnahas.github.io/doc/nahas_tutorial) and not original code.

## Lean

- **Codewars** : Solutions to some Lean problems on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com)
- **TPiL Exercises** : Solutions to some of the exercises of [Theorem Proving in Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean)
- **Group Theory.lean** : A collection of miscellaneous group theory problems

## Peano

This folder contains an implementation of natural numbers and integers along with some basic functions in Haskell as well as an extensive compilation of arithmetic theorems of natural numbers starting from Peano's axioms in Lean.

## Project Euler Exercises

These contain Haskell implementations of the primary functions involved in the first few solutions of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).
