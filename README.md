# Jan '20 Semester Project

These four folders contain all my saved work in Haskell, Coq and Lean from Dec '19 to Jun '20.

1) Coq: This is the smallest folder for reasons explained in the project report. Most of the folder is not original code but simply me experimenting with Mike Nahas's Tutorial ([2] in the report).

2) Lean:

    a) Codewars: Codewars is a website where people can post as well as solve challenging programming problems and improve their skills. Each file in the folder contains the name of the contributer along with a link to the original question/collection.
    
    b) TPiL Exercises: These are solutions to some parts of the exercises of "Theorem Proving by Lean" ([3] in the report)
    
    c) Group Theory: It is a collection of miscellaneous group theory problems.

3) Peano: This contains two Haskell versions of Peano's axioms (one for natural numbers and one extended to integers) and some basic functions as well as an extensive compilation of arithmetic lemmas based on the Peano's axioms in Lean.

4) Project Euler Exercises: These contain the primary functions involved in solving the first few problems of Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/archives).
